# hello-world
Let's learn something new. 

Hello, my name is Dustin and I am 25 years old and I'm currently trying to expand my knowledge into web development and programming.
I graduated university with a degree in Graphic Design, but I feel like (here in the real world) that is not enough.
While I am learning these new skills, my unborn child is growing in my wife's belly.

Can he expand his knowledge to allow him to achieve a raise to support his upcoming family, or will he deem the task too difficult and give up? Let's find out!
